[![crates.io badge](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pallet-plonk.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/pallet-plonk)[![Pallet Test](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/plonk/actions/workflows/pallet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/plonk/actions/workflows/pallet.yml)  
This library supports for using zkSNARK plonk on substrate and is implemented as an extension of [duck-network plonk](https://github.com/dusk-network/plonk).

## Abstract

We'd like to implement the plonk library as a pallet in order for developers to customize circuits and use the plonk protocol.

The following functions are the libraries we are going to implement as pallet.

- Custom Circuit
- Generate proof
- Verify proof
